# Flagimgo: Advanced Feature Flag Management System in Go

**Flagimgo** is an open-source, feature flag management system designed to give granular control over feature availability across different environments, regions, and usage limits. Built with flexibility and configurability in mind, Flagimgo provides dynamic feature flag management, real-time statistics collection, and a user-friendly interface for seamless operations.

## Key Features

### 1. **Feature Management by Environment**
   - Assign and control feature flags based on different environments such as development, staging, and production to manage feature rollouts in isolated conditions.

### 2. **Feature Management by Region**
   - Enable or disable features based on geographical regions, allowing you to customize the feature availability based on the target audience in various locations.

### 3. **Round Bond Limit Control**
   - Manage feature availability using round-based algorithms to set predefined limits. The system supports controlling feature rollouts based on:
     - **Usage limits:** Set maximum allowed uses of a feature during a round.
     - **Time periods:** Define availability within specific time frames, such as day-based or month-based windows.

### 4. **Statistics Collection**
   - Collect and analyze real-time metrics and statistics on feature usage, including:
     - Feature activation rates
     - User interactions and feedback loops
     - Historical usage trends
   - This data helps guide decisions on whether to roll out, rollback, or fine-tune features.

### 5. **Fully Configurable**
   - Flagimgo is highly configurable, allowing you to customize feature behavior based on:
     - Environment and region
     - Bond limits and thresholds
     - Custom rules for feature flag evaluations ensure the system adapts to your needs.

### 6. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - The web-based UI simplifies feature flag management, clearly visualizing feature settings, availability, and usage trends. This allows technical and non-technical users to quickly toggle, update, and monitor features without diving into the codebase.
